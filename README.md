## Development notice
This plugin is being developed for a private server. This means I may never finish this plugin, nor keep it updated. It's just here for reference. But it also means it's never really done. It's in active development.

## License
Do whatever. I don't care. I just ask for your morality to not straight up rip the code and sell it as a premium plugin.. but hey, I'm not gonna stop you.
